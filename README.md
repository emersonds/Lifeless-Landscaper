# Lifeless-Landscaper
You are an undead landscaper responsible for maintaining your graveyard's grounds! But be careful, loud mowing will wake up your local ghouls...and they do NOT like being awakened from their forever sleep!

This project is being developed for [Ludum Dare 54](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54), "Limited Space."

The "Limited Space" theme is the driving theme of the game, where the player has a limited space to mow the graveyard due to ghastly enemies and gravestones.

The core gameplay loop involves the player mowing the grass, with the grass's mowed appearance changing depending on the direction the player was moving (just like in real life). Ghosts, zombies, and other creatures will get in the way, further limiting the space the player has to mow and creating a bit of challenge. The level will complete when the player has successfully mowed all of the grass.

All assets and code are created originally by me unless otherwise noted.
